-A/B Test Name:  Sign in screen split between 2 different pages compared to a single page
- User Story Number: US1 Account Creation
- Metrics:  NPM Score
- Hypothesis: Having 2 screens that look cleaner will be better than 1 packed screen.
- What problem are we trying to solve?: We are trying to make sure our sign up is as painless as possible so that users can start to use the app as quick as possible.
- Experiment - We will ask if the user was satified with their sign up experience with our google survey
  - Describe the audiences.
    - we will allocate 50% of the users to each category
  - Describe the tracking using Firebase Analytics. 
    - we will be mainly using google survey for this A/B Test
- Variations - We would like to shorten the logon page to a single packed page to see if users prefer that expeience instead of a cleaner multi page approach.
